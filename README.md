## 🔬 Methodology

Our approach progresses through multiple algorithmic enhancements:

1. **Baseline Implementation**: K-means clustering with optimized initialization
2. **PSO Integration**: Population-based search with velocity-position updates
3. **Adaptive Mechanisms**: Dynamic parameter control (w(t), c1(t), c2(t))
4. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combined deterministic and stochastic optimization

## 📊 Key Results

- Achieved perfect reliability (100%) with APSO variants
- Demonstrated complexity-dependent performance ranging from 0.988-0.999 for structured datasets to 0.566-0.693 for complex scenarios
- Successfully reduced computational complexity while maintaining accuracy
- Established effectiveness of hybrid PSO-based clustering for complex, high-dimensional datasets
